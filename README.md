Calculate the discount and price of shipment following these rules:
  - All S shipments should always match the lowest S package price among the providers.
  - The third L shipment via LP should be free, but only once a calendar month.
  - Accumulated discounts cannot exceed 10 â‚¬ in a calendar month. If there are not enough funds to fully cover a discount this calendar month, it should be covered partially.

Output transactions and append reduced shipment price and a shipment discount (or '-' if there is none).
If the line format is wrong, carrier/sizes are unrecognized 'Ignored' should be appended to the line.
